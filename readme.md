__Identification of bacterial proteins containing the peroxisome
targeting motif__

_order of analysis_

- First performed a search for sequences with "SKL" at the N-terminus using the "peroxisome-targeting-bp.py"

- Then cleaned the data using the "peroxisome-targeting-bp-dataset-manip.py" code
  - UPDATE 17062020 - I need to redo this to make sure that only unique seuqneces are included in the final dataset. - I will screen for this on the basis of gene_ID first - the problem with screening on the basis of sequence for unique sequences is the (low) possibility of missing out a gene present in two seperate bacteria that include the exact same
